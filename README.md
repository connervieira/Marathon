# Marathon

An open source, transparent, self hosted employee management tool.


## Description

Marathon is an employee tracking tool designed to prioritize both employees and their managers. With Marathon, managers can add employees to the system, manage their information, and track payment information. Employees can quickly and easy clock in, clock out, and keep track of their hours and pay. Marathon is completely open source and self hosted, allowing it to be used with any device that can run a browser.
